Pedantic mode
=============

``pytest-benchmark`` allows a special mode that doesn't do any automatic calibration. To make it clear it's only for
people that know exactly what they need it's called "pedantic".

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_with_setup(benchmark):
        benchmark.pedantic(stuff, args=(1, 2, 3), kwargs={'foo': 'bar'}, iterations=10, rounds=100)

Reference
---------

.. py:function:: benchmark.pedantic(target, args=(), kwargs=None, setup=None, rounds=1, warmup_rounds=0, iterations=1)

    :type  target: callable
    :param target: Function to benchmark.

    :type  args: list or tuple
    :param args: Positional arguments to the ``target`` function.

    :type  kwargs: dict
    :param kwargs: Named arguments to the ``target`` function.

    :type  setup: callable
    :param setup: A function to call right before calling the ``target`` function in the first iteration of every round.

        The setup function can also return the arguments for the function (in case you need to create new arguments every time).

        .. sourcecode:: python

            def stuff(a, b, c, foo):
                pass

            def test_with_setup(benchmark):
                def setup():
                    # can optionally return a (args, kwargs) tuple
                    return (1, 2, 3), {'foo': 'bar'}
                benchmark.pedantic(stuff, setup=setup, rounds=100)  # stuff(1, 2, 3, foo='bar') will be benchmarked

        .. note::

            if you use a ``setup`` function then you cannot use the ``args``, ``kwargs`` and ``iterations`` options.

    :type  teardown: callable
    :param teardown: A function to call after the last iteration of every round.

        .. sourcecode:: python

            def stuff(a, b, c, foo):
                pass

            def test_with_teardown(benchmark):
                def teardown():
                    # cleanup the side effect of the previous bench mark round.
                    pass
                benchmark.pedantic(stuff, teardown=teardown, rounds=100)

        .. note::

            the ``teardown`` function receives the same ``args`` and ``kwargs`` as the ``target``.

    :type  rounds: int
    :param rounds: Number of rounds to run.

    :type  iterations: int
    :param iterations:
        Number of iterations.

        In the non-pedantic mode (eg: ``benchmark(stuff, 1, 2, 3, foo='bar')``) the ``iterations`` is automatically chosen
        depending on what timer you have. In other words, be careful in what you chose for this option.

        The default value (``1``) is **unsafe** for benchmarking very fast functions that take under 100Î¼s (100 microseconds).

    :type  warmup_rounds: int
    :param warmup_rounds: Number of warmup rounds.

        Set to non-zero to enable warmup. Warmup will run with the same number of iterations.

        Example: if you have ``iteration=5, warmup_rounds=10`` then your function will be called 50 times.
